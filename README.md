# object_detection_using_YOLO
The repository contains objection detection code. Here we have used pretrained Yolo model for detecting objects in an image and video

By using the link below we can download the weights and cfg file for the object detection.

In the code we have used cfg and weights file of yolov3-320. In case if u download cfg and weights file of yolov3-416 then replace YOLO_IMAGE_SIZE = 320
with YOLO_IMAGE_SIZE = 416 and if u download yolov3-608 then replace YOLO_IMAGE_SIZE = 320 with YOLO_IMAGE_SIZE = 608 in the .py code
